  # Choose where the widget should sit on your screen.
  verticalPosition    : "bottom"        # top | bottom | center
  horizontalPosition    : "left"        # left | right | center
  margin: "80px"                        # Sets a margin at the `verticalPosition'

  widgetTheme: "dark"                   # dark | light

  # Song metadata inside or outside? Applies to large and medium variants only.
  metaPosition: "inside"                # inside | outside

  # Stick the widget in the corner? Set to *true* if you're using it with Sidebar widget, set to *false* if you'd like to give it some breathing room and a drop shadow.
