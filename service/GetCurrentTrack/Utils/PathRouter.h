 @brief Creates a router based on paths with the path regexes and selectors.
 @discussion
 Creates the router by specifying pairs of path regexes and selectors, that will apply
 in the order found in the arrays.

 The paths are can be defined as a regular expression with capture groups that will be
 passed in the first argument of the selector (PathRequest). The start and end of line
 characters cannot be used.

 The selectors must receive two parameters: an PathRequest and a HTTPResponse. If not,
 weird errors can happen.

 @param paths An array of path regexes.
 @param selectors An array of selectors that will be called when the path is matched.

 Tries to match a path with the request.

 delegate. If the delegate has not defined the selector, nothing will do.

 @param res The HTTP response object.
 @return `true` if there's a path that matched any path regex.
