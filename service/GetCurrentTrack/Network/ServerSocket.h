 @brief An easy TCP server socket

 @discussion
 Creates a TCP server socket that listens for coonections and calls the delegate.
 If there's no delegate, or the delegate doesn't implement the ServerSocketDelegate,
 the server will close the client socket.

 Uses GCD to avoid blocking the main thread. The delegate will run in any thread.

 @brief Starts listening at the desired address and port.

 The server will listen at address and it can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
 Every new connection will be transfered to the delegate, if any.

 If any error occurrs, it will show the error in the log and return false.
